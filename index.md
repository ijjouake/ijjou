## Welcome,

<html>
<body>
<p>My name is Ijjou, a business analyst with a background in statistics and management..</p>
<p> Getting insights out of data to build a business strategy is something that I really like. 
I am a big open source believer, therefore I prefer to use R and python for my daily work.
</p>
<p> On my website you can find some examples of my projects, most of them are interactive visualization.

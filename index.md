## Welcome,

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ijjouake/ijjou.git.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ijjouake/ijjou.git.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Define server logic to summarize and view selected dataset ----

    # Return the requested dataset ----
    # By declaring datasetInput as a reactive expression we ensure
    # that:
    #
    # 1. It is only called when the inputs it depends on changes
    # 2. The computation and result are shared by all the callers,
    #    i.e. it only executes a single time

    # Create caption ----
    # The output$caption is computed based on a reactive expression
    # that returns input$caption. When the user changes the
    # "caption" field:
    #
    # 1. This function is automatically called to recompute the output
    # 2. New caption is pushed back to the browser for re-display
    #
    # Note that because the data-oriented reactive expressions
    # below don't depend on input$caption, those expressions are
    # NOT called when input$caption changes
    output$caption <- renderText({
        input$caption
    })
    
    # Generate a summary of the dataset ----
    # The output$summary depends on the datasetInput reactive
    # expression, so will be re-executed whenever datasetInput is
    # invalidated, i.e. whenever the input$dataset changes
    output$summary <- renderPrint({
        dataset <- datasetInput()
        summary(dataset)
    })
    
    # Show the first "n" observations ----
    # The output$view depends on both the databaseInput reactive
    # expression and input$obs, so it will be re-executed whenever
    # input$dataset or input$obs is changed
    output$view <- renderTable({
        head(datasetInput(), n = input$obs)
    })
    
}

# Create Shiny app ----
